# ToolBox

A versatile image processing and computer vision GUI application built using Python. This project integrates several image manipulation techniques, filters, and transformations into a single, user-friendly interface.

## Features

### Image Processing
- **Basic Operations**: 
  - Image browsing, saving, and restoring.
  - Grayscale conversion.
  - Image rotation and flipping.
  - Cropping with mouse interaction.
- **Image Compression**:
  - Lossless and lossy compression.

### Filters and Transformations
- **Transformations**:
  - Translation (top, bottom, left, right, diagonal).
  - Skewing (left and right).
- **Filters**:
  - Gaussian, median, bilateral, and custom kernel filters.
  - Sharpening and edge detection (Sobel, Laplacian, Canny).
  
### Advanced Features
- **Histogram Operations**:
  - Display and equalization of histograms.
- **Segmentation and Detection**:
  - K-means segmentation.
  - Contour detection.
  - Simple geometric shape detection.
- **Custom Transformations**:
  - Logarithmic and power-law transformations.
  - Bit-plane slicing.
  
### Theming and Customization
- Light and dark mode options for better user experience.
